# Furniture-Landing-Page

I developed a one-page portfolio website for my client's furniture store. The website showcases the store's design philosophy, product highlights, and key contact information, all wrapped in a sleek, modern layout. Built with simplicity in mind, it ensures a smooth user experience while visually reflecting the brand's aesthetic.

Please note that only a portion of the full site is currently displayed, with the client's permission.
